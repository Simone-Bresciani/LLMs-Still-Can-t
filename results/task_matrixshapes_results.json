Compute the hadamard product of the result with a matrix of shape (9,4).","1":"Multiply a matrix of shape (3,3,3) with a matrix of shape (3,3,3). Compute the kronecker product of the result with a matrix of shape (4,3,3). Sum the result over the second axis. Multiply the result with a matrix of shape (9,3). Add the result to a matrix of shape (12,3).

After multiplying with (9,3), the shape becomes (9,3). Adding (12,3) gives (12,3), and the hadamard product with (12,3) keeps the shape.","2":"The kronecker product multiplies the shapes element-wise, resulting in a new shape. Transposing does not change the shape.","3":"Hadamard product preserves shape, resulting in (3,3). Kronecker product multiplies shapes, resulting in (6,12).","4":"Resulting matrix has shape (3*2, 3*2, 3*4, 2*4) due to kronecker product property."},"correct":{"0":false,"1":false,"2":true,"3":true,"4":false}}
